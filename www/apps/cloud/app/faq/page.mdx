In this guide, you'll find answers to frequently asked questions about Cloud.

## Do I need to learn about Medusa to use Cloud?

Since you deploy Medusa projects on Cloud, you need a developer who is familiar with Medusa to set up your project and add customizations for your business needs. Learn about Medusa in the [Getting Started](!docs!/learn) guide.

You can also contact a [Medusa Expert](https://medusajs.com/experts/) to help you with building your Medusa project and deploying it on Cloud.

## Does Medusa support hosting storefronts on Cloud?

Medusa can only host Medusa servers and admin dashboards. To host your storefront, you can use hosting providers like Vercel.

Learn more in the [Connect Production Storefront](../connect-storefront/page.mdx) guide.

## What resources does Medusa provide in Cloud?

Medusa fully-manages your [PostgreSQL databases](../database/page.mdx), [Redis instances](../redis/page.mdx), and [S3 buckets](../s3/page.mdx) on Cloud. You don't need to configure or maintain them.

## Can I deploy multiple projects on Cloud?

## Can I use my custom plugins and modules on Cloud?

Yes, you can use any custom and out-of-the-box plugins and modules in your Medusa project deployed on Cloud. You retain the same flexibility as you would with a self-hosted Medusa project.

You can deploy projects like marketplaces, B2B, subscription-based stores, and more on Cloud.

## Does Medusa create new Medusa projects for each deployment on Cloud?

No, Medusa does not create new Medusa projects for your deployments. Instead, it deploys your existing Medusa project from your GitHub repository.

## Can I use a static IP address for my Medusa project on Cloud?
