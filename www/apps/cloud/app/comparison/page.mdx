# {metadata.title}

In this guide, you'll learn about the main differences between hosting your Medusa application on Cloud and self-hosting it. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to make an informed decision about which option is best for your use case.

## What is Self-Hosting?

Self-hosting means deploying and managing your Medusa application on your own infrastructure or a hosting provider of your choice, such as AWS, Railway, or DigitalOcean.

Developers with infrastructure management experience may consider self-hosting their Medusa application to have greater control over their deployment environment and potentially reduce costs.

However, before choosing self-hosting, it's important to understand the challenges that come with it, the efforts it requires, and whether Cloud can provide a better solution for your needs.

## Code Ownership

Both self-hosting and Cloud allow you to own and manage your Medusa application codebase.

When you deploy your Medusa application on Cloud, you deploy it from your own GitHub repository. The code remains entirely yours. Cloud only manages the deployment and hosting of your application.

---

## Configurations

### Self-Hosting: Manual Configurations

When you **self-host**, you must manually configure the server for production. You also need to configure database connections, event services, locking mechanisms, and other [Infrastructure Modules](!resources!/infrastructure-modules) that your Medusa application may use.

There may also be platform-specific configurations, adding another layer of complexity that will slow down your time to launch. You'll also need to maintain these configurations over time as Medusa updates are released.

### Cloud: Pre-configured Environments

On **Cloud**, Medusa offers:

- Pre-configured environments optimized for Medusa applications with no configuration required on your end.
- Automated setup and management of infrastructure components.
- Integrated services like [PostgreSQL](../database/page.mdx), [Redis](../redis/page.mdx), and [S3](../s3/page.mdx).

All of these features are available out-of-the-box in your Cloud projects. By using Cloud, you can reduce the time and effort required to get your application up and running, allowing you to focus on building and shipping features.

---

## Deployment & Production Readiness

### Self-Hosting: Complex and Time-Consuming Setup

When you **self-host**, you need to manually set up the production environment, including scaling, monitoring, and logging. You'll need to build deployment pipelines and processes to ensure smooth deployments and rollbacks.

Additionally, your self-hosted environment must be production-ready with best security practices, performance optimizations, and high-availability configurations.

Supporting this setup requires extensive knowledge of infrastructure management. You must also dedicate time and resources to maintain the infrastructure.

### Cloud: Automated Deployment

On **Cloud**, Medusa manages your deployment environment and ensures it's optimized for production. Medusa:

- Handles scaling automatically based on your traffic. More information in the [Auto-Scaling](#auto-scaling) section.
- Rolls out your code updates with zero downtime, ensuring a smooth experience for your users.
- Provides [logging](../logs/page.mdx) features to track your application's performance without additional setup.

---

## Auto-Scaling

### Self-Hosting: Manual Setup and Management

Auto-scaling is essential to maintain performance and availability during high traffic periods, such as sales or promotions.

When you **self-host**, you must set up and manage scaling policies and infrastructure manually. You must configure load balancers, auto-scaling groups, and monitoring tools to ensure your application can handle traffic spikes.

If not set up correctly, your application may experience performance degradation or downtime during high traffic periods.

### Cloud: Automatic Scaling

On **Cloud**, Medusa automatically scales your application based on traffic. This ensures optimal performance without manual intervention.

Medusa adjusts the number of instances running your application based on demand, ensuring your users have a seamless experience even during traffic spikes. You don't need to configure or manage any scaling policies or infrastructure, as Medusa handles everything for you.

---

## High-Availability

### Self-Hosting: Risk of Downtime

When you **self-host**, you are responsible for setting up and managing redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability. You must monitor your application's health and respond to incidents manually.

If your infrastructure fails and you don't have proper failover mechanisms in place, your application may experience downtime, leading to a poor user experience.

### Cloud: Highly Reliable with 24/7 Monitoring

Medusa provides high-availability features on **Cloud** to ensure your application remains online and responsive. Medusa:

- Monitors your application's health 24/7 and automatically responds to incidents.
- Implements failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and ensures your application is always available.
- Offers [SLA-backed response and uptime](../pricing/page.mdx) based on your plan to guarantee your application's availability.

By using Cloud, you can focus on building your application without worrying about downtime or availability issues.

---

## Performance

### Self-Hosting: Manual Optimization

When you **self-host**, you are responsible for optimizing and monitoring your application's performance. You must configure caching mechanisms, database optimizations, and other performance-enhancing techniques.

If not optimized correctly, your application may experience slow response times, leading to a poor user experience.

### Cloud: Continuous Performance Monitoring

Medusa provides continuous performance monitoring and optimization on **Cloud**. Medusa continuously monitors applications to identify performance bottlenecks and build tooling to resolve them.

Cloud users benefit from these optimizations without any additional effort or configuration, ensuring their applications run smoothly and efficiently.

---

## Developer Experience

### Self-Hosting: Slower Developer Experience

When you **self-host**, you may miss out on features like code previews and push-to-deploy, making it difficult to review and ship changes quickly. You'll also find it challenging to reproduce production issues, as you'll need to set up staging environments manually, adding to the complexity.

### Cloud: Enhanced Developer Experience

Medusa enhances the developer experience on **Cloud** by providing features like:

- GitHub integration for [push-to-deploy](../deployments/page.mdx#how-are-deployments-created).
- [Preview environments](../environments/preview/page.mdx) to test changes in pull requests before merging.
- [Staging environments](../environments/page.mdx) to test new features and reproduce issues in a production-like setting.

By using Cloud, you streamline your development workflow and reduce the time and effort required to manage and ship features.

---

## Data Backup

### Self-Hosting: Risky if Not Done Properly

When you **self-host**, you need to set up data backup and recovery processes manually. This includes scheduling regular backups, storing them securely, and testing recovery procedures. Failing to implement a robust backup strategy can lead to data loss in the event of errors or disasters.

### Cloud: Automated Backups and Recovery

Medusa provides automated backups and recovery options on **Cloud** based on your [plan](../pricing/page.mdx). Backups are performed reliably and stored securely, reducing the risk of data loss. You can restore your data if needed without affecting your application's availability.

---

## Support

### Self-Hosting: Community Support

When you **self-host**, you rely on community support and documentation for assistance. While the Medusa community is active and helpful, you may not receive timely responses to critical issues or answers that are specific to your business use case. Limited support may slow down your development and affect your application's reliability.

### Cloud: Dedicated Support

Medusa offers dedicated [support](https://medusajs.com/medusa-support/) options for **Cloud** users based on their [plan](../pricing/page.mdx). You receive timely assistance to help resolve issues, upgrade your application, and improve performance. Medusa provides the necessary resources to maintain and grow your application.

---

## Cost

### Self-Hosting: Variable Costs

When you **self-host**, your costs vary based on your chosen infrastructure and usage patterns. At minimum, you'll need server and worker instances, a PostgreSQL database, and a Redis instance. You'll likely need additional services like S3 for file storage or monitoring tools.

Depending on your traffic and usage, costs can add up quickly, especially if the infrastructure isn't optimized for cost efficiency.

### Cloud: Cost-Competitive Pricing

Medusa offers a cost-competitive pricing model on **Cloud** compared to self-hosting. You can choose a [plan](../pricing/page.mdx) that fits your needs and budget, with the flexibility to scale as your application grows.

---

## Get Started with Cloud

[Sign Up](../sign-up/page.mdx) on Cloud to get started and deploy your first application in minutes.

### Migrate in Two Steps

If you have an existing self-hosted Medusa application, you can migrate it to Cloud by:

1. [Creating a project](../projects/page.mdx) and connecting it to your existing GitHub repository.
2. [Importing your production database](../database/page.mdx#importexport-database-dumps) to Cloud.

You'll then have a fully managed Medusa application deployed on Cloud, with all the benefits mentioned above, including automated deployment, scaling, and enhanced developer experience.
