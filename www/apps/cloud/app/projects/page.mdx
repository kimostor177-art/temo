In this guide, you'll learn about projects, how to create them, view their details, and manage their settings in Cloud.

## What is a Project?

A project is the collection of resources, environments, deployments, and settings related to a Medusa application deployed to the Cloud. The project is linked to a GitHub repository that hosts the Medusa application's code.

To deploy a Medusa application to the Cloud, you create a project for it. Medusa will automatically set up and configure the necessary resources in the project to run the application, such as PostgreSQL, Redis, and S3.

Each project can have multiple environments, such as production and staging. These environments allow you to test changes before pushing them live to users. You can learn more in the [Environments documentation](../environments/page.mdx).

## Create a Project

In this section, you'll learn how to create a project in Cloud to deploy your Medusa application.

<Note title="Prerequisites">

Make sure your organization's plan supports creating more projects. If you've exceeded the number of projects limit for your plan, contact support to upgrade your plan.

</Note>

To create a project:

1. Make sure you're viewing the [correct organization's dashboard in Cloud](../organizations/page.mdx#switch-organization).
2. Click on the **Create Project** button in your organization's dashboard.

In the project-creation page, you can either [create from a starter](#1-create-project-from-a-starter) or [create from an existing application](#2-create-project-from-an-existing-application).

---

## 1. Create Project from a Starter

Medusa provides you with the following starters that you can use to quickly set up your ecommerce application:

- **DTC Starter**: Standard Medusa application with fully-fledged commerce features.
- **B2B Starter**: Medusa application with powerful B2B and commerce features.

To create a project from either of these starters:

1. Click on the **Browse Starters** button at the top right of the [project creation page](#create-a-project).
2. Click the **Clone** button of the starter you want to use.
3. In the Repository step, authenticate with your GitHub account if you haven't already.
4. Choose a GitHub organization to clone the starter into in the "Organization" field.
    - If you don't see your organization, you can click the **Configure accessible organizations** link to manage accessible organizations in GitHub.
5. In the "Repository name" field, enter a name for your new repository.
6. Once you're done, click the **Continue** button.

The repository will be cloned and you'll move forward to the [Configure step](#configure-project-during-creation).

---

## 2. Create Project from an Existing Application

If you already have a Medusa application, you can create a project from it.

### Prerequisite: Medusa Application Configurations

Your existing Medusa application doesn't need specific configurations to be deployed to Cloud. Medusa will automatically:

- Create the necessary [server and worker instances](!docs!/learn/production/worker-mode).
- Scale your Medusa application's resources based on the traffic it receives.
- Set up and configure production resources and modules for your Medusa application:
    - [Redis Cache Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/cache/redis)
    - [Redis Event Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/event/redis)
    - [Redis Locking Module Provider](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/locking/redis)
    - [Redis Workflow Engine Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/workflow-engine/redis)
    - [S3 File Provider Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/file/s3)

So, make sure to remove any of these modules from your `medusa-config.ts` file, unless you want to use custom options for them. In that case, you're expected to manually set up and manage those resources externally and configure them in your Medusa application.

### Project Creation Steps

To create a project from an existing Medusa application:

1. In the GitHub section of the [project-creation page](#create-a-project), authenticate with your GitHub account if you haven't already.
2. Under the Repository section, choose the repository to create the project from.
    - If you don't see your repository, you can click the **Configure repositories** link to manage the GitHub repositories that Medusa can access.
3. Once you're done, click the **Continue** button.

You'll move forward to the [Configure step](#configure-project-during-creation).

---

## Configure Project During Creation

After selecting the repository, you'll move on to the project configuration step. You can set the following information:

1. **Project name**: Enter the name of the project.
2. **Project subdomain**: Enter a custom subdomain for the project. All projects are subdomains of `medusajs.app`.
    - For example, if you enter `my-project`, the project will be accessible at `my-project.medusajs.app`. Refer to the [subdomain restrictions](#subdomain-restrictions-for-projects) section for more details.
3. You can expand the "Build details" section to optionally change its configurations:
    - **Region**: Select a [region](#available-regions-for-projects-in-cloud) to deploy the project. For better performance, choose a region that's closer to your target users. The region can't be changed later.
    - **Project root directory**: If your project is in a monorepo, specify the path to the Medusa project in the repository. Otherwise, leave it empty.
4. You can expand the "Environment variables" section to optionally add environment variables:
    - Enter the key and value for each environment variable you want to add.
    - Mark the variable as "Sensitive" to hide its value in the UI.
    - To add more variables, click the "Add another" button.
    - You can also add and change environment variables later in the project's environment settings.
5. You can expand the "Initial user" section to optionally set up the credentials of the initial admin user for the Medusa Admin:
    - **Email**: The email of the initial admin user.
    - **Password**: The password of the initial admin user.
6. Once you're done configuring the project, click the "Create" button.

After creating the project, it will take a few minutes to create the necessary resources for it and deploy it. You'll be redirected to the organization dashboard, where you can see the project in the list of projects.

<Note>

If the project creation takes too long, check out the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting-project-creation).

</Note>

If you click on the project, you'll be taken to the project's dashboard, where you can view [its details and status](#find-project-details).

Once the project is created and deployed, you'll receive a notification in the Cloud dashboard. You can also view its status in the list of projects and in the project's details.

## Troubleshooting Project Creation

If you encounter any issues while creating a project, [check common deployment issues and their solutions](../deployments/troubleshooting/page.mdx)

---

## Subdomain Restrictions for Projects

Your project's URL must be a subdomain of `medusajs.app`. For example, if you choose `my-store` as your subdomain, your project's URL will be `my-store.medusajs.app`.

When you choose a subdomain for your project, it must be at least five characters long. It also can't be one of the following reserved subdomains:

- `medusa`
- `admin`
- `staging`
- `production`
- `preview`
- `development`
- `proxy`

---

## Available Regions for Projects in Cloud

Medusa supports hosting your Medusa projects on Cloud in the following regions:

- US East (`us-east-1`)
- Europe Central (`eu-central-1`)
- Asia Southeast (`ap-southeast-1`)

All your project's deployments will be in the selected region. For better performance, choose a region that's closer to your target users. If you need to host your Medusa project in a different region, contact support.
