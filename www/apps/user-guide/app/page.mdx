## Tour of Medusa Admin

After you log into your Medusa Admin, you'll see a navigation sidebar with a search bar at the top, a <InlineIcon Icon={BellAlert} alt="bell" /> notifications icon in the header, and the main content area in the center.

### Sidebar Menu

The sidebar menu includes the main navigation of your Medusa Admin. You can use it to navigate between different domains, such as the Products or Orders pages.

![Sidebar Menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1739529281/User%20Guide/Screenshot_2025-02-14_at_12.34.22_PM_oeyaol.png)

You can hide the sidebar by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={SidebarLeft} alt="sidebar" /> icon at the top next to the sidebar. Clicking it again will show the sidebar.

### Sidebar Shortcuts

Sidebar items have shortcuts. For example, the Products page has a <Kbd>G</Kbd> then <Kbd>P</Kbd> shortcut. To view the shortcut of an item, hover your mouse over it for a few seconds and a tooltip will appear with the shortcut.

You can also find all shortcuts by clicking on your profile item at the bottom of the sidebar and selecting "Shortcuts".

### Settings and Quick Actions

At the bottom of the sidebar, you'll find a Settings item, which takes you to additional settings for your store such as Region and Sales Channel management. You'll also find your avatar and name.

By clicking on your avatar and name, you'll see quick actions such as accessing profile settings, viewing shortcuts, or changing the admin theme.

### Search Bar

At the top of the sidebar, you'll find a search item that opens the search window. You can also open the search window using these keyboard shortcuts:

- Windows and Linux: <Kbd>CTRL</Kbd> + <Kbd>K</Kbd>
- Mac OS: <Kbd>⌘</Kbd> + <Kbd>K</Kbd>

You can select a result with your mouse, or use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate between the results, then choose a result by pressing the <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> key.

### Check Notifications

At the top end of the header, you'll find a <InlineIcon Icon={BellAlert} alt="Bell" /> icon. Clicking this icon opens a side window to view any notifications you might have. Use this to view notifications such as completed product exports.
