In this guide, you’ll learn how to manage product tags in the Medusa Admin.

## View Product Tags

Product tags allow you to group products in your store by common tags. For example, you can create tags for "electronics" or "clothing" and assign them to products.

To view product tags in your store, go to Settings → Product Tags. Here, you can see a list of all the product tags you have set up in your store. You can also search, filter, and sort the product tags to find the one you are looking for.

## Manage Product Tag Metadata

<Note>

Management of product tag metadata was added in [Medusa v2.10.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.10.0).

</Note>

Metadata is custom data that can be associated with the product tag in key-value pairs. This is usually used by developers for custom integrations or to store additional information about the product tag.

To edit the product tag's metadata:

1. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowUpRightOnBox} alt="arrow" /> icon in the "Metadata" section.
2. In the side window that opens:
    - Manage the key-value pairs in the table.
    - To add a new row of key-value pairs before or after a row:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its end.
        - Choose "Insert row above" or "Insert row below" from the dropdown.
    - To delete a row of key-value pairs:
        - Hover over the row and click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisVertical} alt="three-dots" /> icon at its end.
        - Choose "Delete row" from the dropdown.
3. Once you're done, click the Save button.
