# {metadata.title}

In this guide, you'll learn how to view workflow executions in the Medusa Admin.

<Note>

This guide is primarily useful for developers and technical teams building and debugging customizations of a Medusa application.

</Note>

## What are Workflow Executions?

[Workflows](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows) are a series of steps that perform a task. You build workflows in your source code to implement custom commerce flows and features.

When you execute a workflow, Medusa runs the steps in sequence to complete the task. If you've configured the workflow to store its executions in the database as explained in the [Store Workflow Executions guide](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows/store-executions), you can view the workflow's executions and their details in the Medusa Admin. This is useful for debugging workflows and ensuring they run as expected.

## View Workflow Executions

To view workflow executions, go to Settings → Workflows. There, you'll find a list of custom and Medusa workflows that have been executed and are stored in the database. You can search through the list to find the one you're looking for.

![Workflow executions list](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1740496862/User%20Guide/Screenshot_2025-02-25_at_5.16.30_PM_fjkbrc.png)

### Workflow Execution Status

In the list, you can view the status of each workflow execution. A workflow execution's status can be:

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Status
      </Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Description
      </Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Not Started
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The workflow has been executed, but its steps haven't been invoked yet.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Invoking
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The workflow execution is currently running and invoking its steps.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Done
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The workflow execution has completed successfully.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Failed
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The workflow execution has failed.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Compensating
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The workflow execution is compensating its steps after a failure.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Reverted
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The workflow execution has been reverted, which occurs when the workflow runs as part of another workflow and the parent workflow fails.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

## View Workflow Execution Details

To view a workflow execution's details:

1. Go to Settings → Workflows.
2. Click on the workflow execution to view it.

On the workflow execution's page, you'll find multiple sections containing the execution's details.

![Workflow executions details](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1740496967/User%20Guide/Screenshot_2025-02-25_at_5.22.33_PM_z6al6a.png)

### Summary Section

In the first section, you'll find a summary of the workflow execution, including:

- A badge at the top end of the section indicating the [execution's status](#workflow-execution-status).
- The workflow's unique ID, which you specify when you create the workflow.
- The transaction ID, which is a unique identifier for the workflow execution. This is useful for debugging, tracking, and changing step statuses of [long-running workflows](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows/long-running-workflow).
- The workflow's progress, which shows a quick overview of the steps that have been executed.

### Timeline

The timeline diagram shows you the step-by-step execution of the workflow. You can zoom in and out, and drag the mouse to view the entire diagram. You can also click on a step to view its execution details in the [History](#history) section.

#### Step Status

In the timeline diagram, each step node has a small box whose color indicates the step's status:

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Color
      </Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Description
      </Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Orange
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The step is currently being executed.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Green
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The step has been executed successfully.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Red
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The step has failed.
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        Gray
      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>
        The step hasn't been executed yet, or it has been skipped, which can occur if the step is part of a [when condition](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/workflows/conditions).
      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

### JSON

The JSON section allows you to view the execution's details as a raw JSON object by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowUpRightOnBox} alt="expand" /> icon. This is useful for advanced debugging to see all the details of the workflow execution.

### History

The History section shows you the execution of the workflow's steps in order of execution. You can see each step's name with a dot reflecting its status as explained in the [Step Status](#step-status) section.

If you click on any executed step, you'll see its details, including:

- **Definition**: the step's configurations that can be passed when you create the step. For example, the step's name, whether it has a compensation function, or whether it's asynchronous.
- **Output**: the step's output, which is the result of the step's execution.
- **Compensation Input**: if the workflow failed and the step has a compensation function, you can see the input that the compensation function received.
- **Error**: if the step failed, you can see the error message.
