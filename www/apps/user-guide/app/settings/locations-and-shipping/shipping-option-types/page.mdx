## What is a Shipping Option Type?

A shipping option type is a classification of shipping options that share similar characteristics. For example, you can have a shipping option type for "Standard Shipping" and another for "Express Shipping".

Shipping option types help you organize and manage your shipping options. They also allow you to set promotions for specific types of shipping options.

By default, Medusa comes with two shipping option types: "Standard" and "Express". You can manage these types or create new ones to better fit your business needs.
