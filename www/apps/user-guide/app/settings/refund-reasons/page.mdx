In this guide, you’ll learn what refund reasons are and how to manage them.

<Note>

Refund reason management is available from [Medusa Admin v2.11.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.11.0). If you don't see the Refund Reasons option in your Medusa Admin, request your technical team to [upgrade your Medusa application](!docs!/learn/update).

</Note>

## What's a Refund Reason?

A refund reason is a predefined reason for refunding an order. It helps you categorize and track refunds in your store.

When [processing a refund](../../orders/payments/page.mdx#refund-payment), you can select a reason from the list of refund reasons you have set up.

## View Refund Reasons

To view refund reasons in your store, go to Settings → Refund Reasons. Here, you can see a list of all the refund reasons you have set up in your store. You can also search, filter, and sort the refund reasons to find the one you are looking for.

Medusa adds some default refund reasons to your store. You can use or [delete](#delete-a-refund-reason) them.
