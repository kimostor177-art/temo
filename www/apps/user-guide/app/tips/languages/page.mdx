Medusa Admin comes with multi-language support. Multi-language support is only for the Medusa Admin interface, not for the content, such as product description.

This document covers the complete list of available languages, both official and by the community.

## How to Change the Language

To learn how to change the language, refer to the [Manage Profile](../../settings/profile/page.mdx) guide.

## Right-to-Left (RTL) Language Support

<Note>

Right-to-left (RTL) language support is available from [Medusa Admin v2.11.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.11.0). If your dashboard doesn't adjust to RTL languages, request your technical team to [upgrade your Medusa application](!docs!/learn/update).

</Note>

When you change the language to a right-to-left (RTL) language, such as Arabic or Hebrew, the Medusa Admin interface automatically adjusts to support RTL text direction. This includes aligning text and UI elements appropriately for better readability and user experience.
