In this guide, you'll learn how to view and manage campaigns.

## What is a Campaign?

A campaign is a collection of promotions related to specific marketing or sales goals. A campaign also gives you granular control over promotion usages, allowing you to set up start and end dates, and budget usages that once exceeded, the promotions of the campaign can't be used anymore.

## View Campaigns

To view the campaigns in your store, go to Promotions -> Campaigns from the sidebar.

In the list, you can see campaign details such as the name, description, and identifier. You can also search, filter, and sort the campaigns to find the specific item you are looking for.

## Create Campaign

To create a campaign:

1. Go to Promotions -> Campaigns from the sidebar.
2. Click on the Create button in the main section's header.
3. In the form that opens:
    - Enter the campaign's name and identifier in their respective fields.
    - Optionally add a description in the Description field.
    - Optionally set a start date in the "Start date" field. Promotions in this campaign can only be used after this date.
    - Optionally set an end date in the "End date" field. Promotions in this campaign are expired after this date.
    - You can set a campaign budget of the following types:
        - **Usage**: How many times the promotions in the campaign can be used. Once the number of times exceed the limit, the campaign and its promotions expire.
        - **Spend**: The total amount that can be discounted by the promotions in the campaign. Once the total amount discounted exceeds the limit, the campaign and its promotions expire. This is not applicable to "Buy X Get Y" or "Free Shipping" promotions.
    - If you chose the **Spend** type, select the currency of the limit in the "Currency" field.
        - When adding promotions to the campaign later, promotions that discount a fixed amount can only be added if the currency matches the campaign budget's currency.
    - In the **Limit** field, you can set a campaign budget limit based on the type you chose.
        - If you chose **Usage**, enter the number of times the promotions in the campaign can be used.
        - If you chose **Spend**, enter the total amount that can be discounted by the promotions in the campaign.
    - If you chose the **Usage** type, you can optionally set the **Limit usage per** field to apply the limitation for each customer or email.
        - If you don't select any condition, the limit is applied globally. For example, if the limit is set to 5, the promotions in the campaign can be used a total of 5 times.
        - If you select "Customer", the limit is applied for each customer based on their unique identifier. For example, if the limit is set to 5, each customer can use the promotions in the campaign 5 times.
        - If you select "Customer Email", the limit is applied for each customer based on their email address. For example, if the limit is set to 5, each unique email address can use the promotions in the campaign 5 times.
4. Once you're done, click the Create button.

<Note>

The **Limit usage per** field is available from [Medusa Admin v2.11.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.11.0). If you don't see it, request your technical team to [upgrade your Medusa application](!docs!/learn/update).
