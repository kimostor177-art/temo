In this chapter, you’ll learn about Infrastructure Modules.

## What is an Infrastructure Module?

An Infrastructure Module implements features and mechanisms related to the Medusa application’s architecture and infrastructure.

Since modules are interchangeable, you have more control over Medusa’s architecture. For example, you can choose to use Memcached for event handling instead of Redis.

## Infrastructure Module Types

There are different Infrastructure Module types including:

![Diagram illustrating how the modules connect to third-party services](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1759762284/Medusa%20Book/service-infra_k3fcy0.jpg)

- [Analytics Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/analytics): Integrates a third-party service to track and analyze user interactions and system events.
- [Caching Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/caching): Defines the caching mechanism or logic to cache computational results.
- [Event Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/event): Integrates a pub/sub service to handle subscribing to and emitting events.
- [Workflow Engine Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/workflow-engine): Integrates a service to store and track workflow executions and steps.
- [File Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/file): Integrates a storage service to handle uploading and managing files.
- [Notification Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/notification): Integrates a third-party service or defines custom logic to send notifications to users and customers.
- [Locking Module](!resources!/infrastructure-modules/locking): Integrates a service that manages access to shared resources by multiple processes or threads.

<Note>

The Caching Module was introduced in [Medusa v2.11.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.11.0) to replace the deprecated Cache Module.
