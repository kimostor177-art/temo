# deleteShippingOptionTypesWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `deleteShippingOptionTypesWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow deletes one or more shipping-option types. It's used by the
[Delete Shipping Option Types Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-option-types\_deleteshippingoptiontypesid).

This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions after the shipping-option types are deleted. For example,
you can delete custom records linked to the shipping-option types.

You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around shipping option type deletion.

:::note

This is available starting from [Medusa v2.10.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.10.0).

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### shippingOptionTypesDeleted

This hook is executed after the types are deleted. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the deleted types.

#### Example

```ts
import { deleteShippingOptionTypesWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

deleteShippingOptionTypesWorkflow.hooks.shippingOptionTypesDeleted(
  (async ({ ids }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"[input](../../../core_flows.Shipping_Options.Workflows_Shipping_Options/page.mdx#__type-1)","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"ids","type":"`string`[]","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" openedLevel={1} sectionTitle="shippingOptionTypesDeleted"/>

## Emitted Events

This section lists the events that are either triggered by the `emitEventStep` in the workflow, or by another workflow executed within this workflow.

You can listen to these events in a subscriber, as explained in the [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers) documentation.
