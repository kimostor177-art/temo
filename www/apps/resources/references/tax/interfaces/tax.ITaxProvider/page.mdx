# ITaxProvider

### Identifier Property

Each tax provider has a unique identifier defined in its class. The provider's ID
will be stored as `tp_{identifier}_{id}`, where `{id}` is the provider's `id`
property in the `medusa-config.ts`.

For example:

```ts title="src/modules/my-tax/service.ts"
export default class MyTaxProvider implements ITaxProvider {
  static identifier = "my-tax"
  // ...
}
```

### constructor

You can use the `constructor` of your tax provider to access the resources registered in the [Module Container](https://docs.medusajs.com/resources/medusa-container-resources#module-container-resources).

You can also use the constructor to initialize your integration with the third-party provider. For example, if you use a client to connect to the third-party provider’s APIs, you can initialize it in the constructor and use it in other methods in the service.

Additionally, if you’re creating your tax provider as a plugin or a module provider to be installed in any Medusa application and you want to access its options, you can access them in the second parameter of the constructor.

For example:

```ts
export default class MyTaxProvider implements ITaxProvider {
  // ...
  constructor(container, options) {
    // you can access options here

    // you can also initialize a client that
    // communicates with a third-party service.
    this.client = new Client(options)
  }
}
```
