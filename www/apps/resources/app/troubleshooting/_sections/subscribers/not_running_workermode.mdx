If you emit an event, but subscribers listening to that event don't run, it may be because your Medusa application is not running in [worker mode](!docs!/learn/production/worker-mode).

<Note>

If you're a Cloud user and this issue is happening on your deployed Medusa application, contact support for assistance.

</Note>

### Why this Happens

By default, the Medusa application runs both the server, which handles all incoming requests, and the worker, which processes background tasks, in a single process.

In production, you should deploy two separate instances of your Medusa application: one for the server and one for the worker.

However, if you deploy only a server instance, or if you accidentally set the worker mode to `server`, the subscribers won't run because there is no worker process to handle them.

### How to Fix it

#### Deploy a Worker Instance

If you haven't deployed a worker instance of your Medusa application, do so by following the steps in the [Worker Mode of Medusa Instance](!docs!/learn/production/worker-mode) guide.

For example, you should have the following configuration in your `medusa-config.ts` file:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    workerMode: process.env.WORKER_MODE || "shared",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```

In your deployed server Medusa instance, set `WORKER_MODE` to `server`, and in your deployed worker Medusa instance, set `WORKER_MODE` to `worker`.

#### Set the Correct Worker Mode

If this issue is happening locally, ensure that you set the correct worker mode in your `medusa-config.ts` file.

When running the server locally, either don't set the `workerMode` configuration or set it to `shared` in `medusa-config.ts`:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    workerMode: "shared", // or don't set it at all
    // ...
  },
  // ...
})
```
