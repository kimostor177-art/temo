If you use `pnpm` as a package manager in your Medusa application, you might face errors about missing packages. For example:

```bash
can't resolve @medusajs/dashboard
```

You may also receive an error related to Tanstack Query:

```bash
No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one
```

## Why This Error Occurred

Medusa doesn't officially support `pnpm` as a package manager, which may lead to unexpected errors, including issues with package resolution.

For Tanstack Query, the error occurs because the package is required by `@medusajs/dashboard`, but `pnpm` does not automatically install it as a dependency of that package.

---

## How to Fix it

To resolve this error and other potential errors, consider switching to `yarn` as your package manager.

If you still want to use `pnpm`, you must manually install the following packages in your project:

```bash
pnpm add @medusajs/dashboard @medusajs/icons @medusajs/types @medusajs/draft-order @medusajs/ui
```

Make sure to also update these packages whenever you update your Medusa application.

For the Tanstack Query error, you must also install it manually. It must be the same version installed in [@medusajs/dashboard](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/blob/d58462c9c91a3e335d03f758438e109caad1f839/packages/admin/dashboard/package.json#L54):

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/react-query@{version}
```
