## What is an Order Edit?

A merchant can edit an order to add new items or change the quantity of existing items.

An order edit is represented by the [OrderChange data model](/references/order/models/OrderChange).

The `OrderChange` data model is associated with any type of change, including returns or exchanges. However, its `change_type` property distinguishes the type of change being made.

For order edits, the `OrderChange`'s `change_type` is `edit`.

## Add Items in an Order Edit

When a merchant adds new items to an order during editing, the item is added as an [OrderItem](/references/order/models/OrderItem).

Additionally, an `OrderChangeAction` is created. The [OrderChangeAction data model](/references/order/models/OrderChangeAction) represents a change made by an `OrderChange`, such as adding an item.

When an item is added, an `OrderChangeAction` is created with the type `ITEM_ADD`. Its `details` property stores the item's ID, price, and quantity.

---

## Update Items in an Order Edit

A merchant can update an existing item's quantity or price.

This change is recorded as an `OrderChangeAction` with the type `ITEM_UPDATE`. Its `details` property stores the item's ID, updated price, and updated quantity.

---

## Shipping Methods of New Items in the Edit

Adding new items to the order requires adding shipping methods for those items.

These shipping methods are represented by the [OrderShippingMethod data model](/references/order/models/OrderShippingMethod). Also, an `OrderChangeAction` is created with the type `SHIPPING_ADD`.

---

## How Order Edits Impact an Order’s Version

When an order edit is confirmed, the order’s [version](../order-versioning/page.mdx) is incremented.

---

## Payments and Refunds for Order Edit Changes

Once the order edit is confirmed, any additional payment or refund required can be made on the original order.

This is determined by the comparison between the `OrderSummary` and the order's transactions, as mentioned in the [Transactions guide](../transactions/page.mdx#checking-outstanding-amount).
