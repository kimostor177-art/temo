In this guide, you’ll learn about order exchanges.

<Note title="Looking for no-code docs?">

Refer to this [Medusa Admin User Guide](!user-guide!/orders/exchanges) to learn how to manage an order's exchanges using the dashboard.

</Note>

## What is an Exchange?

An exchange is the replacement of an item that the customer ordered with another item.

A merchant creates the exchange, specifying which items to return and which new items to send.

The [OrderExchange data model](/references/order/models/OrderExchange) represents an exchange.

---

## Returned and New Items

When an exchange is created, a return, represented by the [Return data model](/references/order/models/Return), is also created to handle receiving the items back from the customer.

<Note>

Refer to the [Returns guide](../return/page.mdx) to learn more about returns and how they work.

</Note>

The [OrderExchangeItem data model](/references/order/models/OrderExchangeItem) represents the new items to be sent to the customer. It's associated with the `OrderExchange` data model.

---

## Exchange Shipping Methods

An exchange has shipping methods used to send the new items to the customer. They’re represented by the [OrderShippingMethod data model](/references/order/models/OrderShippingMethod).

The shipping methods for the returned items are associated with the exchange's return, as explained in the [Returns guide](../return/page.mdx#return-shipping-methods).

---

## Exchange Payment

The `OrderExchange` data model has a `difference_due` property that stores the outstanding amount.

<Table>
  <Table.Header>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Condition
      </Table.HeaderCell>
      <Table.HeaderCell>
        Result
      </Table.HeaderCell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Header>
  <Table.Body>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        
      `difference_due < 0`

      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>

      The merchant owes the customer a refund of the `difference_due` amount.

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        
      `difference_due > 0`

      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>

      The merchant requires additional payment from the customer of the `difference_due` amount.

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
    <Table.Row>
      <Table.Cell>
        
      `difference_due = 0`

      </Table.Cell>
      <Table.Cell>

      No payment processing is required.

      </Table.Cell>
    </Table.Row>
  </Table.Body>
</Table>

Any payments or refunds made are stored in the [OrderTransaction data model](/references/order/models/OrderTransaction).

## How Exchanges Impact an Order’s Version

When an exchange is confirmed, the order’s [version](../order-versioning/page.mdx) is incremented.
